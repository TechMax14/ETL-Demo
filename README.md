# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

By Rondeaa Reese, Dulce Silva, Max Fishman



*** Find all relevant files in either opt1 or opt2 (representing which option was chosen for the last section, our team worked on both)

*** All the exported csv files from the code can be found in: Crowdfunding_ETL/opt 2/Resources/Exports/...

Navigating using the correct code when creating dataframes
- We refrenced class material when trying to write the correct code for our dataframes. Although the dataframe was more tedious work, we found finding the dataframes to be easier than creating the Database towards the endof our project.
- When creating the database, we found issues in importing our csv files due to cleaning of the data. Postgre SQL would reject our imports due to inncorrect syntax or delimiters. This issue was fixed by using stack overflow to approach our issues.
- Stack overflow and looking at lesson plans from class helped us in working on this project. It was easier to complete the project when looking at eamples from class to solve our problems in our code. Stack Overflow was our friend when approaching the more technical questions about the functions of Postgre SQL. 

Lessons Learned
- One of the lessons learned is setting our paths in our code to connect our tables to our csv and setting your path in postgre to allow for efficient importing of the documents.
- Another lesson learned from this project is the importance of precise code. Our code would run into issues when we forgot to capitalize a letter or used the wromg symbol in code. An example of this is when we kept mispelling the word delimiter in our code that would give our code issues.
